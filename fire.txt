Fire in Your Workspace

If you have a safe evacuation route (minimal or no fire and/or smoke) from the area:

- Stay calm and breathe deeply. Remember that panic can make it harder to think clearly.
- Evacuate the building: to the designated emergency assembly area at a steady pace; there is no need to rush.
- Pull the fire alarm and warn others nearby as you are leaving. Your alertness can help save others.
- Close doors and windows if time permits; this can help slow down the spread of fire and smoke.
- Move away from the fire and smoke whenever possible. Use the stairs, not the elevators.
- Feel the doors with the back of your hand** to check for heat; **do not open them if they are hot.
- Do not re-enter the building** until instructed to do so by emergency responders. Trust their expertise to guide you safely.
- Once outside, from a safe location, call the campus Police Department at 197

if your evacuation route has excessive smoke and/or heat, or the exit door is warm or hot to the touch:

- Stay calm and stay put. Remember, help is on the way.
- Remain in your work area and keep the door closed to prevent smoke from entering.
- Stuff the cracks around the door with towels, lab coats, or any available fabric to keep out as much smoke as possible.
- If there is no immediate danger from flames or smoke outside, open the nearest window to allow fresh air in.
- Signal for help by hanging a visible object (like a sheet or jacket) out of the window.
- Call the police department at 197 and let them know your exact location.
- Do not attempt to jump from upper floors; stay calm and wait for professional assistance.

What Constitutes a Fire Emergency?

A fire emergency can be defined by any of the following situations:
- A building fire evacuation alarm is sounding
- An uncontrolled fire or imminent fire hazard occurs in any building or area of the campus
- Presence of smoke, or the odor of burning
- Spontaneous or abnormal heating of any material, uncontrolled release of combustible or toxic gas, or a flammable liquid spill

 Procedures

Campus buildings shall be immediately and totally evacuated whenever the building evacuation alarm is sounding. Upon discovery of evidence that a fire emergency exists, an individual shall accomplish, or cause to be accomplished, the following actions:
- Activate the building fire alarm in buildings equipped with a manual fire alarm system
- If safe to do so, shut off all machinery and equipment in the area
- Leave the building at once
- Call  Police AT 197; 
- All fires — even extinguished or found extinguished fires — as well as all fire alarms — 
Evacuation Procedures

- It is the responsibility of every person to immediately leave campus buildings whenever the fire alarm is activated or a fire emergency exists and proceed to their evacuation assembly area.
- All students, faculty, and staff are required to leave the building and remain outside until the emergency is over, and shall not restrict or impede the evacuation.
- Department heads are expected to review annually fire prevention and fire survival information with faculty and staff, or to schedule such a presentation with the campus Fire Marshal or the campus Emergency Director.

Interruption of Fire Alarm

- No person may shut off any fire protection or alarm system during a fire emergency incident without the permission of the fire department or police officer in charge.
- It shall be the responsibility of Fire or Police personnel to reset or cause the alarm to be reset.

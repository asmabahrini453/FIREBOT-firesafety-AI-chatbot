Remember that panic can make it harder to think clearly.\\n- Evacuate the building: to the designated emergency assembly area at a steady pace; there is no need to rush.\\n- Pull the fire alarm and warn others nearby as you are leaving. Your alertness can help save others.\\n- Close doors and windows if time permits; this can help slow down the spread of fire and smoke.\\n- Move away from the fire and smoke whenever possible. Use the stairs, not the elevators.\\n- Feel the doors with the back of your hand** to check for heat; **do not open them if they are hot.\\n- Do not re-enter the building** until instructed to do so by emergency responders. Trust their expertise to guide you safely.\\n- Once outside, from a safe location, call the campus Police Department at 197\\n\\nif your evacuation route has excessive smoke and/or heat, or the exit door is warm or hot to the touch:\\n\\n- Stay calm and stay put. Remember, help is on the way.\\n- Remain in your work area and keep the door closed to prevent smoke from entering.\\n- Stuff the cracks around the door with towels, lab coats, or any available fabric to keep out as much smoke as possible.\\n- If there is no immediate danger from flames or smoke outside, open the nearest window to allow fresh air in.\\n- Signal for help by hanging a visible object (like a sheet or jacket) out of the window.\\n- Call the police department at 197 and let them know your exact location.\\n- Do not attempt to jump from upper floors; stay calm and wait for professional assistance.\\n\\nAbout Elevators\\n\\n- Remember: Elevators are not safe to use during a fire.

Upon discovery of evidence that a fire emergency exists, an individual shall accomplish, or cause to be accomplished, the following actions:\\n- Activate the building fire alarm in buildings equipped with a manual fire alarm system\\n- If safe to do so, shut off all machinery and equipment in the area\\n- Leave the building at once\\n- Call  Police AT 197; \\n- All fires — even extinguished or found extinguished fires — as well as all fire alarms — \\nEvacuation Procedures\\n\\n- It is the responsibility of every person to immediately leave campus buildings whenever the fire alarm is activated or a fire emergency exists and proceed to their evacuation assembly area.\\n- All students, faculty, and staff are required to leave the building and remain outside until the emergency is over, and shall not restrict or impede the evacuation.\\n- Department heads are expected to review annually fire prevention and fire survival information with faculty and staff, or to schedule such a presentation with the campus Fire Marshal or the campus Emergency Director.\\n\\nInterruption of Fire Alarm\\n\\n- No person may shut off any fire protection or alarm system during a fire emergency incident without the permission of the fire department or police officer in charge.\\n- It shall be the responsibility of Fire or Police personnel to reset or cause the alarm to be reset.\\n\\nEmergency Hotlines\\n\\nIf you are feeling anxious, remember that there are professionals trained to help in emergencies.  \\nPolice: 197, \\nCivil Protection: 198, \\nSAMU: 190.\\n\\nAdditional Tips for Staying Calm:\\n\\n.
